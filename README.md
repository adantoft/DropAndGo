# DropAndGo
Simple Java implementation of a game combining the games Connect 4 and Go. This was an assignment part of CSC480 - Artificial Intelligence implementing a game and a minmax algorithm along with alpha/beta pruning.

- uses model/view. A simple text UI exists but different UIs can be developed
- game mechanics are static and need to be changed in the code itself; however they are easily modifiable. A better controller could be developed...

Run main to play. After going through initial options, enter 1 through 9 (or whatever board length is set to) to drop pieces onto the board.
